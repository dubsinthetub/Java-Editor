The initial document

{Narnia...where the woods are thick and cool, where Talking Beasts are called to
life, the land beyond the wardrobe, the secret country known only to Peter,
Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. Narnia...where horses talk and hermits like company,
where evil men turn into donkeys, where boys go into battle.
Narnia...the land between the lamp-post and the castle of Cair Paravel,
where animals talk, where magical things happen,the world of wicked dragons
and magic spells, where the very best is brought out of even the worst people,
where anything can happen(and most oftan does).
Narnia...where owls are wise, where some of the giants like to
snack on humans (and, if carefully cooked, on Marsh-wiggles, too),
where a prince is put under an evil spell.
Narnia...where dwarfs are loyal and tough and strong-or are they?}
